A calculator program using Eclipse/Spring/Swing/AWT

This is a calculator for simple calculations

I wanted my calculator to be different than others seen, so I added a KeyListener so my calculator can read keyboard input.
 
In the code you will notice that I comment on every major section to maintain clean and understandable code.

Implemented: array, switch, if, if-else, for, try-catch
